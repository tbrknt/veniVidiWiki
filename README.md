A Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox extension that redirects your Wikipedia requests to Wiki-Zero. Additionally, it lets the anchor links (table-of-content links and references) on Wiki-Zero pages work as expected. The redirection feature can be disabled via the switch on the pop-up menu, which is opened by clicking the logo.
