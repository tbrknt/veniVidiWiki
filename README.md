# VeniVidiWiki

I came, I saw, I knew.

A Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox extension that redirects your Wikipedia requests to Wiki-Zero. Additionally, it lets the anchor links (references, their backlinks and table-of-content links) on Wiki-Zero pages work as expected. The redirection feature can be disabled via the switch on the pop-up menu, which is opened by clicking the logo.

You can install the extension here for Google Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/venividiwiki/hamponpdlhceghibcaciddeoiidpmbaj

You can install the extension here for Mozilla Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/venividiwiki/
